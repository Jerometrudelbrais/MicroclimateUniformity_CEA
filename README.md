# MicroclimateUniformity_CEA
This project explores the realms of microclimates and environmental data monitoring in controlled environmental agriculture (CEA).

To monitor the environmental conditions in the multi-layers cultivation room, a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) sensor system using Arduino technology and InfluxDB software was developed. The system includes sensors that measure temperature, humidity, CO2, and light levels, and sends the data to a web server. The study tested five different locations within the shelved cultivation room for one-week periods. Basic statistics (i.e., average, mean, standard deviation, skewness, etc.), along with uniformity indexes, were employed to assess spatiotemporal variability of the environmental conditions inside the cultivation room. The cultivation room is dedicated to the micropropagation of plants.

This repository includes all the files related to the sensor system, as well the data analysis.
